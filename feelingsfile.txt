John Bird: Actor and comedian dies aged 86
 I feel like I could scream for minutes without letting up
 I gotta tellya I am feeling like a million bucks toda
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I feel guilt
 I feel l
 I think your take on mat feels like very early books mat
 I have a furry feeling in my chest
 I have to admit I am feeling a little silly now
 I feel a little bit depressed for that reason alone
 I think under the circumstances I feel reasonably vindicated
 I feel I know for sure
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I do want the cabin to feel joyous while we are here
