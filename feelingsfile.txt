 I feel like I dunno em no more
 I feel like posting
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I feel your feelings
 I feel worthless
 I feel like I am falling
 I would love to feel the keys
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I have a feeling becka would love a piece of laura again
 I feel like typing
 I feel really annoyed right now and I told you to stop
 I can feel my heart throbbing in my chest
 I see their faces over and over every day feeling revulsion
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I also got my feel good pants today
