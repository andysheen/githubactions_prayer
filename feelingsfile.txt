 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I like the light feeling
 I smiled at my teacher feeling excited and optimistic
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
 I was already feeling cramps
 I could hardly feel the lenses at all
 I am feeling better in many ways this evening
 I was feeling a little bit nostalgic
 I feel tired and achy all the time
 I feel a yes inside when I think about it
 I was feeling pretty normal
 I feel so honoured to work with them
 I feel like I could scream for minutes without letting up
 I feel to be something that is real
 I feel like these shoes run true to size
 I feel after an exam
 I feel like it
 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I feel so overwhelmed I want to scream
 I feel like I could move right in
 I also want to feel in control of something
 I started feeling light headed
