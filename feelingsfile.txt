 I feel form the very essence amp basis of life
 I feel better afterwards when I do
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I feel you 4
 I do not feel like that
 I feel like coming back I could
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I am trying my best to get rid of this feeling
 I feel so honoured to work with them
 I feel my strength coming back each day
 I feel I know for sure
