 I could hardly feel the lenses at all
 I feel like raising a white flag now
 I feel very lucky
 I love and where I feel a keen sense of belonging
 I feel so behind the christmas decorating game this year
 I could feel that the brief doldrums slide was already lifting
 I hope you are feeling fit and well
 I feel my strength coming back each day
 I have been feeling really overwhelmed lately
 I feel like we are getting nothing done
 I need my computer to feel happy and safe
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I see you at my store and I feel happy
