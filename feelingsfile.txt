 I feel so honoured to work with them
 I feel about it just yet
 I feel about it
 I only feel it on sundays
 I feel like coming back
 I feel quite mature
 I feel otherwise
 I feel like raising a white flag now
 I feel I have also put up with a lot
 I feel guilty for being so very glad to be alive
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I feel your feelings
 I feel bad for her
 I feel is no where today I kept track
