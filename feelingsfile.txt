When can I travel by train?
 I do it too when I feel the need
 I was feeling less pain but was so so so exhausted
 I feel like a jerk by leaning on some friends so much
 I know my knee has been feeling good tuck said
 I feel dumbstruck
 I feel tired and achy all the time
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
 I feel yet
 I am feeling very blessed for the friends I have met through
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I feel like we are getting nothing done
 I feel really annoyed right now and I told you to stop
 I have no boundaries so feel free to leave a comment
 I need to feel prepared
