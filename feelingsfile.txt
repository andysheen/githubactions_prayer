Local Focus: Rotorua Heritage Week impacts our future
The Hotel Lobby Restaurant Is Back
America Has a Problem
Caleb Williams Wins the Heisman Trophy
 I have a feeling he may be up to this
 I sweat I instantly feel better
 I just had a funny feeling that something was missing here
 I feel like eating and then going for it
 I remember feeling a peace about that
 I laugh because I feel so tired all the time you know
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I do want the cabin to feel joyous while we are here
 I can feel my heart throbbing in my chest
 I was feeling less pain but was so so so exhausted
