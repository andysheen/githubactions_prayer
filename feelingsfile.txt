 I feel antony s eyes on me
 I feel like I could move right in
 I feel so lucky
 I feel like I could scream for minutes without letting up
 I practically feel his hot breath on my neck as I run
 I feel whenever I am posting
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
 I cant feel your dick if we had sex that time
 I could feel this energy and excitement everywhere
 I feel braggy
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I feel happy about it the actor said
 I feel that I was wrong and the critics are right
 I feel fortunate to be included
 I feel strongly about
 I feel very shamed
 I still feel her looking over my shoulder
 I feel like I know you
 I feel your feelings
