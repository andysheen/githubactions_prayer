 I feel like my camera is a burden
 I was feeling a little bit nostalgic
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I feel bad only paying her 195
 I need to feel prepared
 I practically feel his hot breath on my neck as I run
 I could feel this energy and excitement everywhere
 I assure you a pleasant feeling
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel like an elf when I am there
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
 I gotta tellya I am feeling like a million bucks toda
