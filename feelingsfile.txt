 I feel uncomfortable about car trips
 I feel like that tonight
 I rather feel like this about the consultation
 I feel gifted
 I gotta tellya I am feeling like a million bucks toda
 I was so light feeling
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I only feel it on sundays
 I sweat I instantly feel better
 I feel very very blessed
 I feel nervous
 I never anticipated the anxiousness I would feel pressing a publish button
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel she is growing up faster than I would like
 I feel braggy
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I never anticipated the anxiousness I would feel pressing a publish button
 I feel your feelings
 I feel would be but one: discusted
 I feel like I am back in the swing of things
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
