 I feel I know for sure
 I feel it is wrong
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I am feeling better now
 I feel like I get to do this
 I feel my strength coming back each day
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I don't think I'm alone in feeling this way
 I am the paper real feel book kinda girl
 I feel like I have a bionic face
 I was feeling a little bit nostalgic
 I also got my feel good pants today
