 I started to feel him in everything
 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I feel like my camera is a burden

 I could feel that the brief doldrums slide was already lifting
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel bright and sharp and ready for the world
 I feel confident that things can only get better
