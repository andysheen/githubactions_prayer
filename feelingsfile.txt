 I feel you 4
 I feel after an exam
 I be happy and excited and feel loved and pursued
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I still greatly dislike both but feel they are a necessary evil
 I feel alive
 I feel this way as a web developer
 I had a really bad feeling about it
 I feel is interesting
 I feel so overwhelmed I want to scream
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I feel very bad about the timing of all of this
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I don't think I'm alone in feeling this way
 I always feel so bad
 I feel very very blessed
 I feel it is wrong
 I was feeling so lost and so cold
 I like the dining room to feel very casual and welcoming
