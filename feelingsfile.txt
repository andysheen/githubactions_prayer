Local Focus: Rotorua Heritage Week impacts our future
 I smiled at my teacher feeling excited and optimistic
 I feel I had to write this post
 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I feel like queen elizabeth is stopping by and I am naked
 I feel like I have a bionic face
 I feel bright and sharp and ready for the world
 I feel like these shoes run true to size
 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I just want everyone to feel better now
 I feel like malas to go the clinic because
 I could feel the stares
 I would love to feel the keys
