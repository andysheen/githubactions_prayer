Mortgages: What happens if I miss a payment?
 I was more intrigued than afraid and the feeling was mutual
 I remember that awkward feeling of everyone watching you
 I find my mind feeling these strange sentiments
 I meet fortnightly and I ve told her how I'm feeling
 I only feel it on sundays
 I had a really bad feeling about it
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I feel for them both
 I feel like I am still on the motorway
 I had a really bad feeling about it
 I feel so safe and secure with him
 I had a feeling I d need it
