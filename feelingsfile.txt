 I feel I have also put up with a lot
 I feel like typing
 I first feel him pulsing beneath my tongue I pull away
 I feel that ice is slowly meltin
 I feel like I am back in the swing of things
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I don't think I'm alone in feeling this way
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
 I first feel him pulsing beneath my tongue I pull away
 I feel fine he said
 I haven t been feeling great about my body lately
 I feel this was the most fully formed
 I feel like I am still on the motorway
 I feel very very excited to dive into
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
 I feel so safe and secure with him
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I could feel that the brief doldrums slide was already lifting
 I was so light feeling
