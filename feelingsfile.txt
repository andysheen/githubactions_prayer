 I hate this feeling 19 hours ago
 I still feel her looking over my shoulder
 I like the dining room to feel very casual and welcoming
 I was so light feeling
 I want to feel better about my body
 I feel very very blessed
 I do it too when I feel the need
 I do it too when I feel the need
 I think I should do and what I feel I should do
 I feel like I learned so much from this experience
 I feel yet
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
 I have difficulties breathing and feeling unhealthy
 I feel like I dunno em no more
