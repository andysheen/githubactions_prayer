 I feel so clean and fresh
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
 I have a feeling my kids will love this
 I feel your feelings
 I feel bad only paying her 195
 I could feel putignano s inner pain
 I feel significant
 I would love to feel the keys
 I do really feel that time travels slowly
 I feel them and no one else notices
 I feel like typing
 I feel better now
 I am feeling better in many ways this evening
 I feel this way as a web developer
