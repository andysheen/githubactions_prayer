Former Pope Benedict XVI dies at 95
Mysterious circumstances surround deaths of these Russian tycoons
 I feel the fear of being left out or forgotten
 I feel yet
 I feel like they need that
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
 I get the sweetest feeling erma franklin
 I feel gifted
 I feel tired and achy all the time
 I feel like they need that
 I think your take on mat feels like very early books mat
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I feel hopeful
 I was feeling family history upcoming tests blood work pee test etc
 I got a good feeling that you are a baby boy
 I feel really sad whenever people stress up due to examinations hateitforever
