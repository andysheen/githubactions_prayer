Mortgages: What happens if I miss a payment?
 I woke up feeling very happy
 I feel really annoyed right now and I told you to stop
 I feel as tho I have a purpose
 I feel absurdly materialistic right now
 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I was more intrigued than afraid and the feeling was mutual
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I hate this feeling
 I feel awesome
 I feel like I should be
 I feel a little intimidated
 I feel like saying
 I feel like christmas is really happening
 I feel yet
 I feel like I got my girl back
 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I feel your feelings
