 I can feel my heart throbbing in my chest
 I was so light feeling
 I am feeling pretty darned spunky let me tell you
 I feel your feelings
 I feel its all normal
 I have a feeling I might need to make more :
 I did what all guilty feeling moms would do
 I feel like typing
 I have a furry feeling in my chest
 I feel worthless
 I feel like christmas is really happening
 I feel we should be focusing on a correction higher
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
