Power cut hits 70 properties in Pocklington
York and Harrogate drivers caught drug driving
Flamborough Fire Festival: Viking Longship pulled through village
National Railway Museum releases Flying Scotsman gin
Bumper Christmas at McArthurGlen as sales start
 I feel then
 I feel so honoured to work with them
 I practically feel his hot breath on my neck as I run
 I feel this way as a web developer
 I feel then
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I started to feel him in everything
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I will feel sad and I pity them
 I really do feel bad for you
 I feel like I really missed out
 I just want everyone to feel better now
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I feel some repositioning and greenstuffing coming on
 I feel loyalty is very important
