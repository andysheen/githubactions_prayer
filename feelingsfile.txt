 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I feel like I am falling
 I feel awesome
 I feel significant
 I meet fortnightly and I ve told her how I'm feeling
 I feel significant
 I love and where I feel a keen sense of belonging
 I had two feelings to be honest
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I feel your feelings
 I feel justified enough
 I feel better now thanks
 I feel humbled
 I feel this way as a web developer
 I feel like lisbon definitely loves jane
 I feel it 04:41 06
 I have a feeling I might need to make more :
 I feel would be but one: discusted
 I was feeling so lost and so cold
 I feel like I could scream for minutes without letting up
