 I feel guilt
 I feel really sad when you do that
 I feel I need a list
 I am nowhere near feeling any better
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I am just not feeling it
 I also got my feel good pants today
 I feel I had to write this post
 I feel like that tonight
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I like the light feeling
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
 I feel guilt
 I got a good feeling that you are a baby boy
 I loathe this feeling
 I feel like coming back
 I feel better now
 I feel yet
