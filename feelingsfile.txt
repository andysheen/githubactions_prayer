 I feel very shamed
 I see their faces over and over every day feeling revulsion
 I feel gifted
 I have a furry feeling in my chest
 I feel to be something that is real
 I sweat I instantly feel better
 I feel bad for her
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I really do feel bad for you
 I feel strongly about
 I also want to feel in control of something
 I have a feeling I might need to make more :
 I want to feel our little one kick inside me
 I really feel abandoned by these people in topeka
