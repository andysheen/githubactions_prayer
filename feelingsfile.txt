 I will feel sad and I pity them
 I feel like saying
 I feel very bad about the timing of all of this
 I feel is no where today I kept track
 I feel with the relaxation
 I feel like I could move right in
 I feel my legs flagging beginning to burn
 I have no boundaries so feel free to leave a comment
 I also want to feel in control of something
 I feel great and my posture has improved so much
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I feel like raising a white flag now
 I have been feeling very blah this january february
 I feel justified enough
 I feel old
