 I need my computer to feel happy and safe
 I feel like I know you
 I am nowhere near feeling any better
 I smiled at my teacher feeling excited and optimistic
 I just look away feeling uncomfortable from attraction
 I feel strongly about
 I feel like I dunno em no more
 I practically feel his hot breath on my neck as I run
 I just feel like this
 I just feel numb
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I was feeling family history upcoming tests blood work pee test etc
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I will feel sad and I pity them
 I feel heated up all of a sudden as well
 I have a feeling becka would love a piece of laura again
 I feel badly about something that makes me really happy
 I like to feel important
 I feel trapped
 I feel like I am back in the swing of things
 I feel guilty for being so very glad to be alive
