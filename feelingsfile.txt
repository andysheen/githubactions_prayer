 I haven t been feeling great about my body lately
 I also want to feel in control of something
 I feel and what direction I am going in
 I feel so behind the christmas decorating game this year
 I really do feel bad for you
 I was feeling pretty normal
 I feel I know for sure
 I feel the fear of being left out or forgotten
 I feel I should clean everyday
 I only feel it on sundays
 I feel like I am still on the motorway
