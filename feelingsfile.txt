 I feel after a math exam dec 04 2013
 I feel like an elf when I am there
 I feel for them both
 I feel then
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I never anticipated the anxiousness I would feel pressing a publish button
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I feel like raising a white flag now
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
 I feel like I am under a microscope while eating
 I admit we both feel asleep breastfeeding
 I feel like I'm in a nightmare
 I still greatly dislike both but feel they are a necessary evil
