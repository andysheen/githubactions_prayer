 I feel like queen elizabeth is stopping by and I am naked
 I feel I know for sure
 I could hardly feel the lenses at all
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I feel like an elf when I am there
 I feel you
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel that 18 lands is far too many

 I am the paper real feel book kinda girl
