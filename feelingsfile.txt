 I was so light feeling
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
 I feel like I could move right in
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I feel is no where today I kept track
 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I feel like a kid unwrapping a barbie doll package
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
 I feel quite mature
 I feel like posting
 I really feel abandoned by these people in topeka
 I have a feeling I will keep looking for more challenges
 I feel very bad about the timing of all of this
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I feel like I am under a microscope while eating
 I also feel a sense of achievement
