 I really feel abandoned by these people in topeka
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I was feeling family history upcoming tests blood work pee test etc
 I am feeling
 I feel I know for sure
 I feel justified enough
 I feel nervous
 I never anticipated the anxiousness I would feel pressing a publish button
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I just feel numb
 I loathe this feeling
 I was feeling very healthy
 I could feel that the brief doldrums slide was already lifting
