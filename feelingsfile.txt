John Bird: Actor and comedian dies aged 86
 I feel uncomfortable about car trips
 I could feel the stares
 I need to feel better and no one is helping
 I feel fine expects to play leave a comment
 I have difficulties breathing and feeling unhealthy
 I feel that I was wrong and the critics are right
 I want to feel better about my body
 I have a feeling I might need to make more :
 I really feel abandoned by these people in topeka
 I always feel so bad
 I feel bad I feel sorry and I feel miserable
 I need my computer to feel happy and safe
 I do want the cabin to feel joyous while we are here
 I find kyudo to feel different
 I could hardly feel the lenses at all
 I feel uncomfortable about car trips
 I feel like an elf when I am there
