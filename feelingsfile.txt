 I was feeling so lost and so cold
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
 I feel fine expects to play leave a comment
 I feel like raising a white flag now
 I feel I had to write this post
 I feel that 18 lands is far too many
 I feel horrible pssss: I am way too old for that
 I want you to know I feel completely at ease
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I meet fortnightly and I ve told her how I'm feeling
 I feel a little bit depressed for that reason alone
 I feel uncomfortable about car trips
 I feel about my annadel park bill
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I am the paper real feel book kinda girl
 I feel braggy
 I need to feel better and no one is helping
 I am cranky and grouchy and just feel like eating
 I feel your feelings
