 I feel I know for sure
 I was so light feeling
 I feel very very blessed
 I feel is becoming obsolete
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I rather feel like this about the consultation
 I was feeling nauseous with a painful back amp sore tight belly
 I admit we both feel asleep breastfeeding
 I feel like it also extended my lashes
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I gotta tellya I am feeling like a million bucks toda
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I feel old and worn out and tired
