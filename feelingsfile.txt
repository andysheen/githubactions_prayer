 I practically feel his hot breath on my neck as I run
 I feel horrible pssss: I am way too old for that
 I just feel numb
 I feel like saying
 I feel better now thanks
 I or two in order to feel pretty and fun and approachable
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
 I rather feel like this about the consultation
 I guess feeling sorry for myself
 I feel like I dunno em no more
 I feel like we are getting nothing done
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
 I am trying my best to get rid of this feeling
