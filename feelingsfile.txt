Dubai just dropped a 30% tax on alcohol
PSG suffers shock defeat without Messi or Neymar
 I feel lost in an ocean of other bloggers they work with
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel then
 I feel like typing
 I feel is no where today I kept track
 I still greatly dislike both but feel they are a necessary evil
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I feel in bed with the flu
 I feel like posting
 I feel like I'm in a nightmare
 I feel guilt
 I feel a little vulnerable knowing I was not strapped in
 I feel awesome
 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I feel significant
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I feel really sad when you do that
 I feel like an elf when I am there
 I feel after a math exam dec 04 2013
