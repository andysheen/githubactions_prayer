 I feel absurdly materialistic right now
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I will feel very upset to learn that mrs
 I could feel this energy and excitement everywhere
 I have a feeling I will keep looking for more challenges
 I feel stuck

 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I feel loyalty is very important
 I just want everyone to feel better now

 I am feeling better in many ways this evening
 I feel inside when I eat cake too
 I feel that ice is slowly meltin
 I feel bad for her
