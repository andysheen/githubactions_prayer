 I just had a funny feeling that something was missing here
 I feel fine expects to play leave a comment
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I feel like we as a group can change the world
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I feel in love
 I had two feelings to be honest
 I feel my legs flagging beginning to burn
 I feel like eating and then going for it
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I started to feel those contractions
