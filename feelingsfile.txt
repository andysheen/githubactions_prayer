Three people reportedly killed in Perth hotel fire
 I feel to be something that is real
 I had a really bad feeling about it
 I feel dumbstruck
 I started feeling light headed
 I feel worthless
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I feel is interesting
 I feel and what touches my soul
 I feel with the relaxation
 I first feel him pulsing beneath my tongue I pull away
 I am trying my best to get rid of this feeling
 I feel like my camera is a burden
 I feel this way as a web developer
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
