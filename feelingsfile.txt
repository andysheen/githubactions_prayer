 I get the sweetest feeling erma franklin
 I feel so stuck
 I also feel that I might get some backlash from this post
 I feel horrible pssss: I am way too old for that
 I have no boundaries so feel free to leave a comment
 I feel your feelings
 I am trying my best to get rid of this feeling
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I find kyudo to feel different
 I feel badly about something that makes me really happy
 I feel a little bit depressed for that reason alone
 I admit we both feel asleep breastfeeding
 I just want everyone to feel better now
 I don't feel very well
 I feel hopeful
 I feel like I'm going to faint again
 I always feel like I have so much to learn from them
 I feel so
