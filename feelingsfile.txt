 I feel like saying
 I feel okay
 I feel in love
 I feel like I get to do this
 I feel like I got my girl back
 I could feel that the brief doldrums slide was already lifting
 I have to admit I am feeling a little silly now
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel like lisbon definitely loves jane
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel like lisbon definitely loves jane
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
