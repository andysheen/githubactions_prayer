 I just feel numb
 I feel that I was wrong and the critics are right
 I could almost feel him smiling down
 I feel about my annadel park bill

 I feel so honoured to work with them
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I not feel like a rock star when I finished
 I was feeling pretty normal
 I feel is interesting
