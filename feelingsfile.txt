 I could almost feel him smiling down
 I always feel like I have so much to learn from them
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I feel about it
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I just look away feeling uncomfortable from attraction
 I feel like I 39 m cindy to heshan always the one
 I practically feel his hot breath on my neck as I run
 I feel the loss of that house most keenly

 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I do really feel that time travels slowly
 I just want a general feel okus dokus
 I am feeling better now
