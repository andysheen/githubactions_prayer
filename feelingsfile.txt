 I feel l
 I feel like coming back I could
 I feel like I am eating enough
 I am feeling pretty darned spunky let me tell you
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I feel out of my depth and very much on my own
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I feel bright and sharp and ready for the world
 I am still feeling fine
 I feel like these shoes run true to size
 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I do really feel that time travels slowly
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
