 I feel my strength coming back each day
 I feel great and my posture has improved so much
 I feel to be something that is real
 I feel as though my time on this earth is fully sp
 I feel like an elf when I am there
 I feel like eating and then going for it
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I feel in bed with the flu
 I want to feel better about my body anyway
 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I feel it 04:41 06
 I feel like writing about
 I was feeling less pain but was so so so exhausted
 I feel hopeful
 I feel like I am falling
 I feel and what direction I am going in
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
