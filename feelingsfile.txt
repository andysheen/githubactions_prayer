 I feel some repositioning and greenstuffing coming on
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I feel this was the most fully formed
 I feel justified enough
 I feel less alone and more like I belong
 I feel like I'm in a nightmare
 I feel fortunate to be included
 I feel oddly pulled away from what is to something beyond myself
 I feel so clean and fresh
 I feel horrible pssss: I am way too old for that
 I feel better now
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I don't feel complete without children
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I was really feeling the pressure
