 I feel I have also put up with a lot
 I feel lost in an ocean of other bloggers they work with
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I feel almost fraudulent mentioning it
 I feel like christmas is really happening
 I remember feeling a peace about that
 I haven t been feeling great about my body lately
 I feel most connected to my imagination
 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I be happy and excited and feel loved and pursued
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I think under the circumstances I feel reasonably vindicated
 I was feeling a little bit nostalgic
