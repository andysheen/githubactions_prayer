 I feel trapped
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I can to make you happy healthy feel loved and safe
 I always feel so bad
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I do really feel that time travels slowly
 I still greatly dislike both but feel they are a necessary evil
 I feel a yes inside when I think about it
 I feel fortunate to be included
 I was already feeling cramps
 I feel better now
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I feel your feelings
 I feel for them
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I feel as tho I have a purpose
