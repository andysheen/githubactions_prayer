Thousands of JFK assassination documents released
Warren Buffett is beating the market this year
Champion adaptive surfer knows the power of resilience
This artist paints hyperrealistic wildlife images
 I feel like I am falling
 I feel uncomfortable about car trips
 I feel like malas to go the clinic because
 I could hardly feel the lenses at all
 I want to feel better about my body anyway
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I realized I read about sadness to feel it
 I do want the cabin to feel joyous while we are here
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I hate this feeling
 I smiled at my teacher feeling excited and optimistic
 I had two feelings to be honest
