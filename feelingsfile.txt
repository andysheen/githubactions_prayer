 I feel for them
 I feel like a jerk by leaning on some friends so much
 I feel that ice is slowly meltin
 I was feeling very healthy
 I feel the loss of that house most keenly
 I feel like coming back I could
 I just want a general feel okus dokus
 I can feel it
 I feel called to do this
 I feel like I am back in the swing of things
 I feel better now
 I believe it's not the exact same feeling haha
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I have a feeling becka would love a piece of laura again
