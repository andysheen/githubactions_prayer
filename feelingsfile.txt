How Anger Affects the Body
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I could feel the stares
 I don't feel like I'm being listened to
 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I feel so overwhelmed I want to scream
 I feel like a kid unwrapping a barbie doll package
 I feel like lisbon definitely loves jane
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I also feel a sense of achievement
 I could feel this energy and excitement everywhere
 I feel like I really missed out
 I feel like it also extended my lashes
 I feel out of my depth and very much on my own
 I feel l
 I feel with 187 what 039 s going on
 I feel like I could scream for minutes without letting up
