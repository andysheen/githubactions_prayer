Two Bangladeshi opposition leaders arrested in government crackdown
Portsmouth University loses discrimination case against Indian lecturer
 I find my mind feeling these strange sentiments
 I will feel sad and I pity them
 I had two feelings to be honest
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I feel and what direction I am going in
 I started feeling light headed
 I very likely did something somehow to affect her feelings though
 I am feeling giddiness these days a bit often
 I feel so overwhelmed I want to scream
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I feel so festive
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel like christmas is really happening
 I had two feelings to be honest
