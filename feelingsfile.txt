 I feel strongly about
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I am nowhere near feeling any better
 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I feel like I should be
 I feel fine he said

 I love and where I feel a keen sense of belonging
 I am cranky and grouchy and just feel like eating
