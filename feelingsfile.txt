 I feel like we are getting nothing done
 I love and where I feel a keen sense of belonging
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I haven t been feeling great about my body lately
 I know to describe how I feel about this
 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I feel most connected to my imagination
 I feel your feelings
 I believe it's not the exact same feeling haha
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I feel okay
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
 I feel braggy
 I feel very lucky
