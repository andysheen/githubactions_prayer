This plane might be the future of aviation
 I feel a little vulnerable knowing I was not strapped in
 I feel the loss of that house most keenly
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I have a furry feeling in my chest
 I was so light feeling
 I was feeling less pain but was so so so exhausted
 I feel nervous
 I feel I need a list
 I feel almost fraudulent mentioning it
 I feel like it: tech edition
 I feel like saying
 I feel for them
 I first feel him pulsing beneath my tongue I pull away
 I know my knee has been feeling good tuck said
 I don't feel like it
