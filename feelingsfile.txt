 I feel yet
 I feel with the relaxation
 I feel my strength coming back each day
 I always feel so bad
 I feel I have also put up with a lot
 I want to feel better about my body
 I feel worthless
 I never anticipated the anxiousness I would feel pressing a publish button
 I have a feeling I will keep looking for more challenges
 I feel your feelings
 I am still feeling fine
 I feel like I should be
 I need to feel better and no one is helping
 I feel awful
 I was feeling less pain but was so so so exhausted
 I started feeling light headed
