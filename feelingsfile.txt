 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I have been feeling really overwhelmed lately
 I feel I had to write this post
 I feel I need a list
 I had a feeling I d need it
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I didn't feel much pity
 I feel his arm on mine pulling me in
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel called to do this
 I feel his arm on mine pulling me in
 I feel tired and achy all the time
