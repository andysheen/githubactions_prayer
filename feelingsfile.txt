 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I feel it is wrong
 I feel significant
 I feel fortunate to be included
 I am nowhere near feeling any better
 I or two in order to feel pretty and fun and approachable
 I feel it 04:41 06
 I loathe this feeling
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I had a feeling I d need it
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I never anticipated the anxiousness I would feel pressing a publish button
 I remember that awkward feeling of everyone watching you
