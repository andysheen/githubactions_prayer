Two Bangladeshi opposition leaders arrested in government crackdown
 I feel like coming back I could
 I feel a little intimidated
 I deleted it feeling sure that what I wa
 I want to feel better about my body
 I feel gifted
 I the only one here who feels like dancing
 I am the paper real feel book kinda girl
 I feel like I am falling
 I feel a little vulnerable knowing I was not strapped in
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I see their faces over and over every day feeling revulsion
 I had a feeling I d need it
 I feel like that tonight
 I feel I had to write this post
 I feel gifted
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I feel my strength coming back each day
