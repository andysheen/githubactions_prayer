Qatar Got the World Cup It Wanted
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I am just not feeling it
 I was really feeling the pressure
 I feel is becoming obsolete
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel bad only paying her 195
 I feel like coming back
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I the only one here who feels like dancing
 I feel you
 I was feeling nauseous with a painful back amp sore tight belly
 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
