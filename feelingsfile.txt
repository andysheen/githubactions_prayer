 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I could hardly feel the lenses at all
 I feel his arm on mine pulling me in
 I was feeling family history upcoming tests blood work pee test etc
 I feel for them both
 I feel I have to own a movie soundtrack
 I also want to feel in control of something
 I feel whenever I am posting
 I not feel like a rock star when I finished
