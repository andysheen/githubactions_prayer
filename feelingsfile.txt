Local Focus: Rotorua Heritage Week impacts our future
Two Bangladeshi opposition leaders arrested in government crackdown
 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I feel a yes inside when I think about it
 I feel like I could scream for minutes without letting up
 I feel like I should be
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I hate this feeling 19 hours ago
 I feel nervous
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I am not sure how I feel about it
 I feel I have to own a movie soundtrack
 I just had a funny feeling that something was missing here
 I am the paper real feel book kinda girl
