 I feel like it: tech edition
 I loathe this feeling
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I am feeling pretty darned spunky let me tell you
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
 I assure you a pleasant feeling
 I want to feel our little one kick inside me
 I feel your feelings
 I feel like an elf when I am there
 I feel like I got my girl back
 I see you at my store and I feel happy
 I started to feel those contractions
 I would love to feel the keys
 I am just not feeling it
 I assure you a pleasant feeling
 I don't feel very well
