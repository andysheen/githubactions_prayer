The Webb Telescope Is Just Getting Started
 I feel significant
 I feel humbled
 I feel quite mature
 I am feeling
 I love and where I feel a keen sense of belonging
 I feel she is growing up faster than I would like
 I feel good I feel content and I feel optimistic
 I could almost feel him smiling down
 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I feel like writing about
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I feel like we as a group can change the world
 I feel like I'm in a nightmare
 I feel so lucky
