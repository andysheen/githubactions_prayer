 I feel really sad when you do that
 I woke up feeling very happy
 I also want to feel in control of something
 I feel like these shoes run true to size
 I feel your feelings
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I feel I have to own a movie soundtrack
 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I remember that awkward feeling of everyone watching you
 I just had a funny feeling that something was missing here
 I feel about it
 I feel tired and achy all the time
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I have a feeling becka would love a piece of laura again
 I would love to feel the keys
 I am still feeling fine
 I feel your feelings
 I feel for them both
 I could even begin to explain this movement to without feeling foolish
