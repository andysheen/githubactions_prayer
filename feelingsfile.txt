 I feel like we as a group can change the world
 I feel like posting
 I feel like there has been
 I feel like coming back
 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I really feel abandoned by these people in topeka
 I feel you 4
 I feel so behind the christmas decorating game this year
 I just had a funny feeling that something was missing here
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I haven t been feeling great about my body lately
 I feel like a kid unwrapping a barbie doll package
 I assure you a pleasant feeling
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I feel inside when I eat cake too
 I feel like an elf when I am there
 I feel dumbstruck
 I the only one here who feels like dancing
 I feel like these shoes run true to size
