 I don't feel like I'm being listened to
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
 I have a feeling my kids will love this
 I feel like I could scream for minutes without letting up

 I feel my strength coming back each day
 I also feel a sense of achievement
 I feel like coming back
 I feel so clean and fresh
 I was already feeling cramps
 I also feel that I might get some backlash from this post
