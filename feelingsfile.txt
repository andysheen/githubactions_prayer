 I feel nervous
 I realized I read about sadness to feel it
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
 I feel like I am under a microscope while eating
 I like to feel important
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel old
 I want you to know I feel completely at ease
 I feel like typing
 I feel with 187 what 039 s going on
 I feel the presence of the elf more intensely
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
 I feel trapped
 I think I should do and what I feel I should do
 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I am feeling pretty darned spunky let me tell you
 I feel is no where today I kept track
 I admit we both feel asleep breastfeeding
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I also want to feel in control of something
