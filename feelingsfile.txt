New York governor legalizes human composting after death
 I hate this feeling
 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I like the dining room to feel very casual and welcoming
 I feel fortunate to be included
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I feel old but smell really rather nice rel bookmark permalink
 I was so light feeling
 I feel like eating and then going for it
 I feel like we as a group can change the world
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
