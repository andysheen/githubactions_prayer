 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I remember feeling a peace about that
 I hate this feeling
 I am still feeling fine
 I feel it 04:41 06
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I feel like queen elizabeth is stopping by and I am naked
 I feel it 04:41 06
 I just want everyone to feel better now
 I feel I have also put up with a lot
 I feel out of my depth and very much on my own
 I feel hopeful
 I feel good
 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I feel so stuck
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I feel really inspired
 I don't feel like it
