 I feel dumbstruck
 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I feel great and my posture has improved so much
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I was already feeling cramps
 I was feeling less pain but was so so so exhausted
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I feel like my camera is a burden
 I see their faces over and over every day feeling revulsion
 I feel like eating and then going for it
 I have a feeling I will keep looking for more challenges
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I feel like I learned so much from this experience
 I feel happy about it the actor said
 I know my knee has been feeling good tuck said
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I have a feeling I will keep looking for more challenges
 I feel otherwise
 I feel better now thanks
 I feel tired and achy all the time
