 I do it too when I feel the need
 I feel in bed with the flu
 I feel worthless
 I would answer it's a mixed feeling
 I find my mind feeling these strange sentiments
 I feel so
 I feel like it: tech edition
 I feel with 187 what 039 s going on
 I do it too when I feel the need
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
 I feel like typing
 I feel so festive
