Dog rescued on Christmas Day from Utah mountains
 I guess and feel nothing you are pushing out
 I did what all guilty feeling moms would do
 I feel nervous
 I feel like coming back
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I also feel a sense of achievement
 I will feel very upset to learn that mrs
 I have to admit I am feeling a little silly now
 I feel very very excited to dive into
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I remember that awkward feeling of everyone watching you
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I feel like these shoes run true to size
 I gotta tellya I am feeling like a million bucks toda
 I have a feeling he may be up to this
 I have to admit I am feeling a little silly now
 I feel like I am eating enough
 I think I should do and what I feel I should do
 I feel I have also put up with a lot
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I feel and what touches my soul
