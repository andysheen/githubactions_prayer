 I feel like I should be
 I am not sure how I feel about it
 I feel like I could move right in
 I am feeling giddiness these days a bit often
 I feel awful
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
 I feel so stuck
 I feel better afterwards when I do
 I feel alive
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I feel tired and achy all the time
 I need to feel better and no one is helping
 I find kyudo to feel different
 I also got my feel good pants today
 I feel out of my depth and very much on my own
 I am feeling very blessed for the friends I have met through
 I feel like I am under a microscope while eating
 I feel your feelings
