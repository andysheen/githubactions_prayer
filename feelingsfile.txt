Two Bangladeshi opposition leaders arrested in government crackdown
 I feel a little intimidated
 I feel worthless
 I am feeling
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I feel so special
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I feel otherwise
 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I feel whenever I am posting
 I feel them and no one else notices
 I feel oddly pulled away from what is to something beyond myself
 I feel and what touches my soul
 I feel about it just yet
 I also feel a sense of achievement
 I need to feel prepared
