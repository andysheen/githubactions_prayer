 I need to feel prepared
 I was feeling very healthy
 I feel oddly pulled away from what is to something beyond myself
 I feel so overwhelmed I want to scream
 I hate this feeling
 I hate this feeling
 I find kyudo to feel different
 I feel very bad about the timing of all of this
 I feel the loss of that house most keenly
 I feel the presence of the elf more intensely
 I wonder how he feels about immortale deI libertas vehementor nos etc
 I can feel my heart throbbing in my chest
 I feel for them
 I am trying my best to get rid of this feeling
 I gotta tellya I am feeling like a million bucks toda
 I feel like I get to do this
