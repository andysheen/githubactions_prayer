 I don't feel very well
 I feel like I could move right in
 I feel his arm on mine pulling me in
 I feel and what direction I am going in
 I rather feel like this about the consultation
 I feel almost fraudulent mentioning it
 I always feel like I have so much to learn from them
 I am feeling better in many ways this evening
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
 I feel so lucky
 I feel and what touches my soul
 I feel loyalty is very important
 I feel his arm on mine pulling me in
 I feel like typing
