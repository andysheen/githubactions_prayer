Fire in Russian care home kills 22 people
 I am just not feeling it
 I was already feeling cramps
 I feel like raising a white flag now
 I feel really sad when you do that
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I feel I need a list
 I feel like we are getting nothing done
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I feel it is wrong
 I feel like a kid unwrapping a barbie doll package
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I have difficulties breathing and feeling unhealthy
 I feel form the very essence amp basis of life
