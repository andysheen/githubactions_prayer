Christmas Is On a Sunday. Is Church Canceled?
 I will feel very upset to learn that mrs
 I still greatly dislike both but feel they are a necessary evil
 I feel I should clean everyday
 I feel like christmas is really happening
 I think under the circumstances I feel reasonably vindicated
 I feel about it just yet
 I feel your feelings
 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I didn't feel much pity
 I feel significant
 I feel trapped
