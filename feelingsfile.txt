Weather tracker: cyclone drags pollution towards Sri Lanka
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I feel awful
 I feel less alone and more like I belong
 I want to feel our little one kick inside me
 I feel out of my depth and very much on my own
 I guess feeling sorry for myself
 I sweat I instantly feel better
 I am just not feeling it
 I feel heated up all of a sudden as well
 I feel worthless
 I feel like saying
 I gotta feeling tonight 39 s gonna be a good night
 I remember that awkward feeling of everyone watching you
 I feel the loss of that house most keenly
