 I can feel it
 I want to feel our little one kick inside me
 I like to feel important
 I feel so safe and secure with him
 I feel most connected to my imagination
 I find kyudo to feel different
 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I feel your feelings
 I feel is interesting
 I feel like queen elizabeth is stopping by and I am naked
 I feel really sad whenever people stress up due to examinations hateitforever
 I always feel so bad
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I always feel like I have so much to learn from them
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
