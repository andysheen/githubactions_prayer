National Railway Museum releases Flying Scotsman gin
Bumper Christmas at McArthurGlen as sales start
Ambulance service stands down from critical incident status
 I like the light feeling
 I not feel like a rock star when I finished
 I am cranky and grouchy and just feel like eating
 I feel the fear of being left out or forgotten
 I do feel relieved
 I am feeling better in many ways this evening
 I believe it's not the exact same feeling haha
 I want you to know I feel completely at ease
 I could feel this energy and excitement everywhere
 I feel like I 39 m cindy to heshan always the one
 I feel like typing
 I am cranky and grouchy and just feel like eating
