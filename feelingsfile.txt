 I feel very shamed
 I feel then
 I feel your feelings
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel I have to own a movie soundtrack
 I feel very bad about the timing of all of this
 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I feel very very excited to dive into
 I feel really inspired
 I feel them and no one else notices
 I feel your feelings
 I feel like I got my girl back
 I feel dumbstruck
 I laugh because I feel so tired all the time you know
 I feel gifted
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I realized I read about sadness to feel it
