 I feel like posting
 I would love to feel the keys
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I feel like I'm going to faint again
 I feel like my camera is a burden
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I feel this was the most fully formed
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I see their faces over and over every day feeling revulsion
 I feel braggy
 I feel and what direction I am going in
 I feel for them both
