 I feel like coming back I could
 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I feel about my annadel park bill
 I am just not feeling it
 I feel some repositioning and greenstuffing coming on
 I could feel this energy and excitement everywhere
 I am feeling pretty darned spunky let me tell you
 I smiled at my teacher feeling excited and optimistic
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I feel like coming back I could
 I feel quite mature
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I or two in order to feel pretty and fun and approachable
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I could hardly feel the lenses at all
 I still greatly dislike both but feel they are a necessary evil
 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I am feeling very blessed for the friends I have met through
