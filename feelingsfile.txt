 I did what all guilty feeling moms would do
 I get the sweetest feeling erma franklin
 I am feeling very blessed for the friends I have met through
 I feel called to do this
 I feel the loss of that house most keenly
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I feel lost in an ocean of other bloggers they work with
 I want to feel better about my body anyway
 I feel okay
 I have a feeling he may be up to this
 I feel nervous
 I feel like posting
 I feel old
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I feel like I should be
 I feel a yes inside when I think about it
 I feel like a kid unwrapping a barbie doll package
 I was already feeling cramps
