 I the only one here who feels like dancing
 I feel that I was wrong and the critics are right
 I feel so festive
 I feel better afterwards when I do
 I feel like I dunno em no more
 I feel justified enough
 I feel like it also extended my lashes
 I really feel abandoned by these people in topeka
 I feel its all normal
 I do want the cabin to feel joyous while we are here
 I feel like I could scream for minutes without letting up
 I definitely feel way more prepared on this this time round
 I had two feelings to be honest
 I feel that ice is slowly meltin
 I feel like I get to do this
 I just want a general feel okus dokus
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I feel so safe and secure with him
