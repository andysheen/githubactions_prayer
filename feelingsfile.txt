 I want to feel better about my body anyway
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
 I have a feeling I might need to make more :
 I don't feel like I'm being listened to
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I feel that 18 lands is far too many
 I want to capture feelings and slow moves
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I feel a yes inside when I think about it
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I feel your feelings
 I feel your feelings
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
