The Webb Telescope Is Just Getting Started
 I laugh because I feel so tired all the time you know
 I feel so stuck
 I feel my strength coming back each day
 I feel for them both
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I feel like it also extended my lashes
 I was feeling very healthy
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel like I am falling
 I was more intrigued than afraid and the feeling was mutual
 I need to feel prepared
