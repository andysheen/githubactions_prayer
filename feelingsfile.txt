Santander launches pilot bank card recycling scheme
 I feel like we are getting nothing done
 I feel like writing about
 I feel would be but one: discusted
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I feel the presence of the elf more intensely
 I feel bright and sharp and ready for the world
 I admit we both feel asleep breastfeeding
 I feel like I know you
 I feel better afterwards when I do
 I cant feel your dick if we had sex that time
 I am feeling very blessed for the friends I have met through
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I could almost feel him smiling down
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel like writing about
 I have a feeling I will keep looking for more challenges
 I be happy and excited and feel loved and pursued
 I am not sure how I feel about it
 I got a good feeling that you are a baby boy
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I feel like I am back in the swing of things
 I feel is no where today I kept track
 I feel your feelings
