 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
 I meet fortnightly and I ve told her how I'm feeling
 I feel called to do this
 I feel in love
 I feel like coming back I could
 I feel your feelings
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I feel like I learned so much from this experience
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I was feeling so lost and so cold
 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I only feel it on sundays
 I feel like it: tech edition
 I laugh because I feel so tired all the time you know
 I feel like I am under a microscope while eating
