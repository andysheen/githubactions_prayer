Why Haiti Wants an Armed Intervention
 I hate this feeling 19 hours ago
 I feel awesome
 I feel you
 I guess and feel nothing you are pushing out
 I was really feeling the pressure
 I feel like a jerk by leaning on some friends so much
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I am feeling better now
 I feel really annoyed right now and I told you to stop
 I need my computer to feel happy and safe
 I feel fortunate to be included
 I find kyudo to feel different
 I feel his arm on mine pulling me in
