 I feel yet
 I must admit I feel euphoric
 I feel like I am eating enough
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I had a feeling I d need it
 I feel inside when I eat cake too
 I meet fortnightly and I ve told her how I'm feeling
 I feel like we as a group can change the world
 I feel fine expects to play skip to comments
 I feel like there has been
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
 I feel old
 I feel really sad whenever people stress up due to examinations hateitforever
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I must admit I feel euphoric
 I feel really sad whenever people stress up due to examinations hateitforever
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
