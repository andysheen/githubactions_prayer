Local Focus: Rotorua Heritage Week impacts our future
 I am not sure how I feel about it
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I first feel him pulsing beneath my tongue I pull away
 I could almost feel him smiling down
 I feel absurdly materialistic right now
 I feel its all normal
 I feel like queen elizabeth is stopping by and I am naked
 I feel very lucky
 I am feeling pretty darned spunky let me tell you
 I feel like I am falling
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I want to do I feel like being everything at once
