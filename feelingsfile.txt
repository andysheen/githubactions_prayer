Two Bangladeshi opposition leaders arrested in government crackdown
Metro Bank fined *10m for misleading investors
 I am not sure how I feel about it
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I don't feel like I'm being listened to
 I could feel the stares
 I still feel her looking over my shoulder
 I just had a funny feeling that something was missing here
 I still greatly dislike both but feel they are a necessary evil
 I have a feeling my kids will love this
 I feel braggy
 I feel humbled
 I feel would be but one: discusted
 I was feeling so lost and so cold
 I feel so
 I feel is becoming obsolete
 I feel the loss of that house most keenly
 I started to feel those contractions
 I feel guilty for being so very glad to be alive
