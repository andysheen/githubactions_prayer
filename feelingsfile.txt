 I feel like saying
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I feel and what touches my soul
 I started to feel those contractions
 I gotta feeling tonight 39 s gonna be a good night
 I am feeling giddiness these days a bit often
 I want you to know I feel completely at ease
 I guess feeling sorry for myself
 I was so light feeling
 I feel tired and achy all the time
 I need to feel prepared
 I feel his arm on mine pulling me in
 I feel awful
 I feel very bad about the timing of all of this
 I feel bad only paying her 195
 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I remember feeling a peace about that
