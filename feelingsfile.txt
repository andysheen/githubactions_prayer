 I feel trapped
 I just feel numb
 I also feel a sense of achievement
 I the only one here who feels like dancing
 I not feel like a rock star when I finished
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I was already feeling cramps
 I feel really inspired
 I feel it 04:41 06
 I feel most connected to my imagination
 I feel like my camera is a burden
 I get the sweetest feeling erma franklin
 I must admit I feel euphoric
