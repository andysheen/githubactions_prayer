 I don't feel very well
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
 I feel good
 I want to do I feel like being everything at once
 I feel your feelings
 I feel less alone and more like I belong
 I feel guilty for being so very glad to be alive
 I feel is becoming obsolete
 I feel she is growing up faster than I would like
 I feel like I'm in a nightmare
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel a little vulnerable knowing I was not strapped in
 I feel good
 I meet fortnightly and I ve told her how I'm feeling
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I just feel like this
 I feel bad only paying her 195
 I was feeling pretty normal
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I feel your feelings
 I realized I read about sadness to feel it
 I feel about it just yet
 I feel like these shoes run true to size
