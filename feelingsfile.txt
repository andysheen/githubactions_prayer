Stocks Have Their Worst Year Since 2008
 I also feel a sense of achievement
 I just feel like this
 I never anticipated the anxiousness I would feel pressing a publish button
 I feel you
 I feel your feelings
 I feel its all normal
 I feel significant
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
 I am feeling
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
 I want to capture feelings and slow moves
 I feel otherwise
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
