Walrus swims north to Northumberland after Yorkshire recuperation
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I feel you 4
 I believe it's not the exact same feeling haha
 I am feeling better now
 I not feel like a rock star when I finished
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I gotta feeling tonight 39 s gonna be a good night
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I see you at my store and I feel happy
 I am feeling
 I have a feeling I might need to make more :
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
 I smiled at my teacher feeling excited and optimistic
 I don't feel complete without children
 I get the sweetest feeling erma franklin
 I feel uncomfortable about car trips
 I am a reader I feel like I always have been
