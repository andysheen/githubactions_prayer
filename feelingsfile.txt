Local Focus: Rotorua Heritage Week impacts our future
 I could hardly feel the lenses at all
 I think under the circumstances I feel reasonably vindicated
 I feel like I could move right in
 I feel you
 I only feel it on sundays
 I feel fine expects to play leave a comment
 I feel really inspired
 I would answer it's a mixed feeling
 I would answer it's a mixed feeling
 I could feel putignano s inner pain
 I like the light feeling
 I am the paper real feel book kinda girl
 I gotta feeling tonight 39 s gonna be a good night
 I was more intrigued than afraid and the feeling was mutual
 I feel the presence of the elf more intensely
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
