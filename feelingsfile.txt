 I feel then
 I feel about it
 I am trying my best to get rid of this feeling
 I feel nervous
 I feel that 18 lands is far too many
 I could feel the stares
 I feel absurdly materialistic right now
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I feel pleased to be in senegal
 I just feel numb
 I feel I had to write this post
 I feel a little vulnerable knowing I was not strapped in
