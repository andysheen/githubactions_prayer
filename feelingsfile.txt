Inflation is killing the first dinner date
Colorado library closes due to meth contamination
 I feel called to do this
 I also feel a sense of achievement
 I am still feeling fine
 I feel a little intimidated
 I feel okay
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I cannot feel it
 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I like the light feeling
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I started to feel those contractions
 I feel absurdly materialistic right now
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel in love
 I don't feel like I'm being listened to
 I feel it 04:41 06
