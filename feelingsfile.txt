Clutter Is Good for You
 I am feeling better now
 I feel your feelings
 I feel a yes inside when I think about it
 I have difficulties breathing and feeling unhealthy
 I feel so special
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I see you at my store and I feel happy
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I had a feeling I d need it
 I wonder how he feels about immortale deI libertas vehementor nos etc
 I feel nervous
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I feel your feelings
 I would answer it's a mixed feeling
 I feel like I could move right in
 I feel I should clean everyday
 I feel like I dunno em no more
 I was more intrigued than afraid and the feeling was mutual
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel like coming back
