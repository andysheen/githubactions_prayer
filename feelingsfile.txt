 I feel quite mature
 I feel very shamed
 I was feeling nauseous with a painful back amp sore tight belly
 I guess and feel nothing you are pushing out
 I feel like coming back I could
 I feel very lucky
 I don't feel like it
 I have no boundaries so feel free to leave a comment
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I feel to be something that is real
 I was feeling nauseous with a painful back amp sore tight belly
 I feel stuck
