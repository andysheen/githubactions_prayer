 I feel so clean and fresh
 I could feel this energy and excitement everywhere
 I feel like I could move right in
 I have no boundaries so feel free to leave a comment
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I have to admit I am feeling a little silly now
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel like there has been
 I realized I read about sadness to feel it
 I am feeling better now
 I would answer it's a mixed feeling
 I had a really bad feeling about it
 I hate this feeling
 I was feeling very healthy
 I feel so clean and fresh
 I started to feel him in everything
 I feel about it just yet
