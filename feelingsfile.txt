 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I feel after an exam
 I don't feel complete without children
 I was feeling pretty normal
 I see their faces over and over every day feeling revulsion
 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I would love to feel the keys
 I feel like eating and then going for it
 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I feel like an elf when I am there
 I could even begin to explain this movement to without feeling foolish
 I feel like typing
 I feel really annoyed right now and I told you to stop
