Former Pope Benedict XVI dies at 95
 I really feel abandoned by these people in topeka
 I was feeling nauseous with a painful back amp sore tight belly
 I just want a general feel okus dokus
 I feel your feelings
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I have been feeling very blah this january february
 I be happy and excited and feel loved and pursued
 I will feel sad and I pity them
 I got a good feeling that you are a baby boy
 I feel fortunate to be included
 I feel most twenty somethings will easily relate to
 I feel that ice is slowly meltin
 I feel like I dunno em no more
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I feel its all normal
 I feel most twenty somethings will easily relate to
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
