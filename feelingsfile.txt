 I am feeling
 I have a feeling my kids will love this
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
 I was more intrigued than afraid and the feeling was mutual
 I feel so overwhelmed I want to scream
 I feel like I am eating enough
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I started to feel him in everything
 I like the dining room to feel very casual and welcoming
 I am not sure how I feel about it
 I feel trapped
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
 I feel them and no one else notices
