 I gotta tellya I am feeling like a million bucks toda
 I want to do I feel like being everything at once
 I feel like I am under a microscope while eating
 I feel guilt
 I am still feeling fine
 I feel I have also put up with a lot
 I have no boundaries so feel free to leave a comment
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I feel like malas to go the clinic because

 I feel as though my time on this earth is fully sp
 I can feel it
 I do it too when I feel the need
 I feel like christmas is really happening
