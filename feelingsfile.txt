 I feel its all normal
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I started to feel those contractions
 I feel after a math exam dec 04 2013
 I also feel that I might get some backlash from this post
 I feel uncomfortable about car trips
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I feel that ice is slowly meltin
 I loathe this feeling
 I really do feel bad for you
 I feel them and no one else notices
 I feel old and worn out and tired
