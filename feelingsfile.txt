 I see you at my store and I feel happy
 I feel with the relaxation
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I guess I feel less alone connected in some way
 I feel the presence of the elf more intensely
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I feel so
 I was feeling very healthy
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I feel like I am under a microscope while eating
 I only feel it on sundays
