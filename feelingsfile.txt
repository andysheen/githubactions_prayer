 I still feel her looking over my shoulder
 I feel like I learned so much from this experience
 I guess and feel nothing you are pushing out
 I still feel her looking over my shoulder

 I feel like they need that
 I just feel like this
 I feel like writing about
 I feel otherwise
 I am a reader I feel like I always have been
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
