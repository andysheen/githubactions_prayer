Weather tracker: cyclone drags pollution towards Sri Lanka
 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I feel humbled
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
 I feel very shamed
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I feel for them both
 I feel to old friends as I write my christmas cards
 I have a feeling I might need to make more :
 I think your take on mat feels like very early books mat
 I do really feel that time travels slowly
 I think under the circumstances I feel reasonably vindicated
 I have difficulties breathing and feeling unhealthy
 I not feel like a rock star when I finished
 I feel humbled
 I feel really annoyed right now and I told you to stop
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I would love to feel the keys
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
