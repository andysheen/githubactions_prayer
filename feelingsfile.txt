 I feel your feelings
 I feel I know for sure
 I woke up feeling very happy
 I was already feeling cramps
 I feel really sad when you do that
 I do really feel that time travels slowly
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel like I learned so much from this experience
 I feel I need a list
 I feel humbled
 I feel most twenty somethings will easily relate to
 I feel like my camera is a burden
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I am the paper real feel book kinda girl
 I feel really sad when you do that
 I feel is no where today I kept track
