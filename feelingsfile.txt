 I feel like that tonight
 I feel significant
 I feel like I really missed out
 I feel his arm on mine pulling me in
 I sweat I instantly feel better
 I am a reader I feel like I always have been
 I have been feeling really overwhelmed lately
 I just want a general feel okus dokus
 I was already feeling cramps
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
 I gotta feeling tonight 39 s gonna be a good night
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I feel like typing
 I feel like raising a white flag now
 I admit we both feel asleep breastfeeding
