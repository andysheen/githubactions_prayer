 I feel like there has been
 I have a feeling becka would love a piece of laura again
 I don't feel complete without children
 I need my computer to feel happy and safe
 I feel out of my depth and very much on my own
 I feel justified enough

 I feel like I'm in a nightmare
 I could feel that the brief doldrums slide was already lifting

 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I hope you are feeling fit and well
 I feel significant
