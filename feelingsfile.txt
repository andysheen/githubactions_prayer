 I have a feeling I will keep looking for more challenges
 I feel like I am back in the swing of things
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I know to describe how I feel about this
 I feel most twenty somethings will easily relate to
 I think under the circumstances I feel reasonably vindicated
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I feel braggy
 I have been feeling really overwhelmed lately
 I feel the presence of the elf more intensely
 I always feel like I have so much to learn from them
 I feel badly about something that makes me really happy
 I stand there suddenly feeling so alone
 I feel the fear of being left out or forgotten
 I don't feel very well
 I feel absurdly materialistic right now
 I guess and feel nothing you are pushing out
 I was so light feeling
