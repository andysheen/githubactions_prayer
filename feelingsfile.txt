 I feel guilty for being so very glad to be alive
 I cannot feel it
 I have a furry feeling in my chest
 I was so light feeling
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I feel like I am falling
 I feel whenever I am posting
 I am still feeling fine
 I have been feeling really overwhelmed lately
 I feel awful
 I rather feel like this about the consultation
 I feel awful
 I feel nervous
 I feel very bad about the timing of all of this
 I feel with 187 what 039 s going on
 I do it too when I feel the need
 I feel about it just yet
 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I just want everyone to feel better now
 I don't feel complete without children
