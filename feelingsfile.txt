 I feel my legs flagging beginning to burn
 I feel after an exam
 I feel very shamed
 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I feel like coming back I could
 I want to feel our little one kick inside me
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I feel fortunate to be included
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I have a feeling I might need to make more :
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel this was the most fully formed
 I could feel putignano s inner pain
 I laugh because I feel so tired all the time you know
 I am feeling
 I feel like I am falling
 I still feel her looking over my shoulder
