 I remember feeling a peace about that
 I feel my strength coming back each day
 I do feel relieved
 I feel guilty for being so very glad to be alive
 I feel fine expects to play skip to comments
 I sweat I instantly feel better
 I feel really sad whenever people stress up due to examinations hateitforever
 I laugh because I feel so tired all the time you know
 I do it too when I feel the need
 I had a feeling I d need it
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I feel otherwise
 I feel justified enough
