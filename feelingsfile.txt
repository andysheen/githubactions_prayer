T.C.U. Upends Michigan in Wild Playoff Semifinal
What to Cook This Weekend
 I feel guilty for being so very glad to be alive
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
 I feel like I am under a microscope while eating
 I like the dining room to feel very casual and welcoming
 I feel antony s eyes on me
 I don't think I'm alone in feeling this way
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
 I feel so stuck
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I feel bad I feel sorry and I feel miserable
