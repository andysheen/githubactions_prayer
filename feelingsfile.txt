When Cultural Heritage Becomes a Battlefront
 I have to admit I am feeling a little silly now
 I feel old and worn out and tired
 I feel really annoyed right now and I told you to stop
 I need to feel prepared
 I feel like there has been
 I am feeling pretty darned spunky let me tell you
 I feel like writing about
 I just feel numb
 I feel braggy
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I am feeling a little better but it could be the steroids
 I am feeling giddiness these days a bit often
 I had two feelings to be honest
 I find kyudo to feel different
 I feel like coming back
 I feel like I'm going to faint again
 I feel good
 I have a furry feeling in my chest
 I have to admit I am feeling a little silly now
 I only feel it on sundays
 I feel the fear of being left out or forgotten
