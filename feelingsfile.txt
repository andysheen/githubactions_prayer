Women Are on the March
 I feel awful
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever
 I feel would be but one: discusted
 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
 I just want a general feel okus dokus
 I am just not feeling it
 I guess and feel nothing you are pushing out
 I feel pleased to be in senegal
 I don't feel complete without children
 I am a reader I feel like I always have been
 I feel a little intimidated
 I feel heated up all of a sudden as well
 I feel okay
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I feel good I feel content and I feel optimistic
