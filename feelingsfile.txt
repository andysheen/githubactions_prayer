 I got a good feeling that you are a baby boy
 I want to do I feel like being everything at once
 I feel less alone and more like I belong
 I feel fine expects to play leave a comment
 I feel your feelings
 I feel hopeful
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel very very blessed
 I feel then
 I am the paper real feel book kinda girl
 I feel significant
 I remember feeling a peace about that
 I was feeling nauseous with a painful back amp sore tight belly
 I have to admit I am feeling a little silly now

 I feel bad I feel sorry and I feel miserable
 I feel like I am eating enough
 I was more intrigued than afraid and the feeling was mutual
 I feel in love
