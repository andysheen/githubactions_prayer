 I feel so stuck
 I had two feelings to be honest
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
 I feel and what touches my soul
 I feel great and my posture has improved so much
 I don't feel complete without children
 I just want everyone to feel better now
 I feel significant
 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I feel braggy
 I feel otherwise
 I feel humbled
 I could almost feel him smiling down
