 I feel humbled
 I feel guilt
 I find kyudo to feel different
 I feel old
 I am feeling
 I feel like I get to do this
 I have a feeling he may be up to this
 I feel my legs flagging beginning to burn
 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I loathe this feeling
 I feel good I feel content and I feel optimistic
 I did what all guilty feeling moms would do
 I am feeling
 I feel we should be focusing on a correction higher
 I feel like christmas is really happening
