 I feel out of my depth and very much on my own
 I feel for them
 I need to feel prepared
 I feel really annoyed right now and I told you to stop

 I feel my strength coming back each day
 I feel alive
 I started feeling light headed
 I feel a yes inside when I think about it
 I feel a little bit depressed for that reason alone

 I feel like a kid unwrapping a barbie doll package
 I do it too when I feel the need
 I feel we should be focusing on a correction higher
