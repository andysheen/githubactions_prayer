Two Bangladeshi opposition leaders arrested in government crackdown
 I admit we both feel asleep breastfeeding
 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I sweat I instantly feel better
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I was feeling nauseous with a painful back amp sore tight belly
 I feel awesome
 I feel like raising a white flag now
 I just want a general feel okus dokus
 I feel like they need that
 I don't feel like it
 I feel like a kid unwrapping a barbie doll package
 I like the dining room to feel very casual and welcoming
