 I remember that awkward feeling of everyone watching you
 I don't feel very well
 I want to feel better about my body
 I feel I had to write this post
 I have a feeling becka would love a piece of laura again
 I guess and feel nothing you are pushing out
 I am still feeling fine
 I do really feel that time travels slowly
 I feel out of my depth and very much on my own
