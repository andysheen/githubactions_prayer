 I believe it's not the exact same feeling haha
 I want to capture feelings and slow moves
 I get the sweetest feeling erma franklin
 I am feeling
 I be happy and excited and feel loved and pursued
 I feel horrible pssss: I am way too old for that
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I have a feeling becka would love a piece of laura again
 I didn't feel much pity
 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I want to feel our little one kick inside me
 I feel like a pack mule employed by the grand canyon
 I just want everyone to feel better now
 I feel so stuck
 I can to make you happy healthy feel loved and safe
