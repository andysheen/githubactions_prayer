 I haven t been feeling great about my body lately
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I want to feel better about my body anyway
 I still feel her looking over my shoulder
 I feel this was the most fully formed
 I feel old
 I feel like saying
 I feel really annoyed right now and I told you to stop
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I feel I need a list
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I feel almost fraudulent mentioning it
 I feel better afterwards when I do
 I feel a little vulnerable knowing I was not strapped in
 I feel like I could scream for minutes without letting up
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I feel tired and achy all the time
 I not feel like a rock star when I finished
 I feel that ice is slowly meltin
