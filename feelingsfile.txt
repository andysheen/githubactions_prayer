 I have been feeling really overwhelmed lately
 I am not sure how I feel about it
 I feel I have also put up with a lot
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
 I feel the fear of being left out or forgotten
 I could hardly feel the lenses at all
 I have a feeling I will keep looking for more challenges
 I feel fine expects to play skip to comments
 I woke up feeling very happy
 I feel inside when I eat cake too
 I like to feel important
 I feel like queen elizabeth is stopping by and I am naked
 I feel less alone and more like I belong
