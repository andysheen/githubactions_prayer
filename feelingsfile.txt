 I was feeling a little bit nostalgic
 I remember feeling a peace about that
 I am trying my best to get rid of this feeling
 I feel like I learned so much from this experience
 I feel your feelings
 I feel for them
 I feel so honoured to work with them
 I feel like my camera is a burden
 I was more intrigued than afraid and the feeling was mutual
 I get the sweetest feeling erma franklin
 I feel so clean and fresh
 I feel the fear of being left out or forgotten
