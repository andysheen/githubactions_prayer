 I feel like coming back I could
 I feel so special
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
 I have a furry feeling in my chest
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I have a feeling becka would love a piece of laura again
 I remember feeling a peace about that
 I also feel that I might get some backlash from this post
 I feel like typing
 I very likely did something somehow to affect her feelings though
 I feel like it
 I feel like raising a white flag now
 I feel guilt
 I see you at my store and I feel happy
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
 I gotta feeling tonight 39 s gonna be a good night
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
 I feel like queen elizabeth is stopping by and I am naked
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I feel like I really missed out
