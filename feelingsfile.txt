 I feel to be something that is real
 I need my computer to feel happy and safe
 I feel that ice is slowly meltin
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I would love to feel the keys
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I realized I read about sadness to feel it
 I feel like I'm going to faint again
 I know to describe how I feel about this
 I feel your feelings
 I feel in bed with the flu leave a comment
 I am feeling
 I am feeling better now
