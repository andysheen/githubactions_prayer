 I feel a yes inside when I think about it
 I could feel the stares
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I feel the fear of being left out or forgotten
 I feel less alone and more like I belong
 I feel I had to write this post
 I was feeling so lost and so cold
 I don't feel complete without children
 I must admit I feel euphoric
 I always feel so bad
 I just look away feeling uncomfortable from attraction
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I need to feel prepared
 I am feeling very blessed for the friends I have met through
 I feel like my camera is a burden
 I was more intrigued than afraid and the feeling was mutual
