 I feel I had to write this post
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I haven t been feeling great about my body lately
 I feel trapped
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I just want everyone to feel better now
 I feel after an exam
 I feel like everyone masturbates yeah
 I feel that ice is slowly meltin
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel heated up all of a sudden as well
 I feel them and no one else notices
 I feel awful
 I can feel it
 I feel guilty for being so very glad to be alive
 I am just not feeling it
