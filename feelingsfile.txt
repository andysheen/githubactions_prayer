John Bird: Actor and comedian dies aged 86
 I feel about my annadel park bill
 I still greatly dislike both but feel they are a necessary evil
 I feel hopeful
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I have been feeling very blah this january february
 I feel horrible pssss: I am way too old for that
 I feel justified enough
 I feel and what touches my soul
 I feel the presence of the elf more intensely
 I feel like coming back I could
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I am feeling pretty darned spunky let me tell you
 I feel like typing
 I still feel very tired and have low energy
 I don't feel like it
 I feel so
