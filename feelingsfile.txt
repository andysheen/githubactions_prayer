When can I travel by train?
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I was feeling nauseous with a painful back amp sore tight belly
 I feel and what direction I am going in
 I feel guilt
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I feel happy about it the actor said
 I feel awful
 I feel she is growing up faster than I would like
 I feel like I'm in a nightmare
 I see their faces over and over every day feeling revulsion
 I just look away feeling uncomfortable from attraction
 I would love to feel the keys
 I feel quite mature
