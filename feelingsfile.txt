 I could even begin to explain this movement to without feeling foolish
 I want you to know I feel completely at ease
 I feel gifted
 I feel worthless
 I gotta tellya I am feeling like a million bucks toda
 I have to admit I am feeling a little silly now
 I hope you are feeling fit and well
 I feel old and a little bit of an underachiever

 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
 I feel like these shoes run true to size
 I feel like I really missed out
 I am still feeling fine
 I need my computer to feel happy and safe
