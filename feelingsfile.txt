They Fought the Lawn. And the Lawn Lost.
 I feel most twenty somethings will easily relate to
 I am a reader I feel like I always have been
 I was feeling family history upcoming tests blood work pee test etc
 I feel your feelings
 I also want to feel in control of something
 I also got my feel good pants today
 I feel very very excited to dive into
 I hate this feeling
 I think I should do and what I feel I should do
 I feel I have to own a movie soundtrack
 I guess feeling sorry for myself
 I was feeling less pain but was so so so exhausted
 I feel so honoured to work with them
 I feel the exorcist is overrated
 I feel I have to own a movie soundtrack
 I feel worthless
 I feel like posting
