 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I like the light feeling
 I feel inside when I eat cake too
 I feel I had to write this post
 I want to feel better about my body
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I was feeling so lost and so cold
 I do feel relieved
 I want to feel our little one kick inside me
 I feel like it also extended my lashes
 I realized I read about sadness to feel it
 I did what all guilty feeling moms would do
 I feel I know for sure
 I haven t been feeling great about my body lately
