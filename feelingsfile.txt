 I feel like writing about
 I still feel like nothing very interesting is going on
 I do want the cabin to feel joyous while we are here
 I feel confident that things can only get better

 I feel guilt
 I feel like malas to go the clinic because
 I feel bright and sharp and ready for the world
 I feel like I could move right in
