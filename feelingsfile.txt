 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I was feeling family history upcoming tests blood work pee test etc
 I feel trapped
 I feel like I am falling
 I feel we should be focusing on a correction higher
 I feel this way as a web developer
 I feel like coming back
 I feel uncomfortable about car trips
 I feel significant
 I hate this feeling
 I feel in bed today with the flu
 I did what all guilty feeling moms would do
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I feel a bit sad when people just fade out
 I do feel relieved
 I feel as though my time on this earth is fully sp
 I feel emptier and less supported
 I feel about it
 I gotta tellya I am feeling like a million bucks toda
