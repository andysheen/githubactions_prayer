 I feel like an elf when I am there
 I feel really inspired
 I feel your feelings
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I feel out of my depth and very much on my own
 I was really feeling the pressure
 I loathe this feeling
 I feel your feelings
 I want you to know I feel completely at ease
 I feel like writing about
 I like the light feeling
 I feel your feelings
