 I feel worthless
 I really feel like I would be missing out on something
 I feel loyalty is very important
 I feel whenever I am posting
 I don't feel very well
 I feel like I get to do this
 I feel awesome
 I feel badly about something that makes me really happy
 I feel with 187 what 039 s going on
 I don't feel complete without children
 I feel them and no one else notices
 I am feeling giddiness these days a bit often
