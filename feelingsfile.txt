Time Is Way Weirder Than You Think
 I really feel abandoned by these people in topeka
 I am still feeling fine
 I feel most connected to my imagination
 I stand there suddenly feeling so alone
 I feel like phil spector and sometimes I feel like howard hughes
 I feel fine expects to play skip to comments
 I was feeling very healthy
 I have a feeling my kids will love this
 I was feeling so lost and so cold
 I don't feel complete without children
 I like the dining room to feel very casual and welcoming
 I feel like everyone masturbates yeah
 I feel is becoming obsolete
 I know most of the people will feel suffocating here
 I feel so stuck
 I feel so overwhelmed I want to scream
 I will feel sad and I pity them
