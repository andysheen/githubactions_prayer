China to drop quarantine requirement for overseas visitors
 I always feel so bad
 I feel like I am letting you down
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I know to describe how I feel about this
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
 I did what all guilty feeling moms would do
 I feel bad only paying her 195
 I feel the loss of that house most keenly
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel as tho I have a purpose
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I have been feeling really overwhelmed lately
 I just feel like this
