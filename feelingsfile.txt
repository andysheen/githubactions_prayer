 I feel as tho I have a purpose
 I just feel like this
 I want to feel my entire spectrum of emotions
 I see you at my store and I feel happy
 I like the light feeling
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I feel fine he said
 I feel you
 I cant feel your dick if we had sex that time
 I started feeling light headed
 I cannot feel it
 I feel that I was wrong and the critics are right
 I feel otherwise
 I gotta feeling tonight 39 s gonna be a good night
 I feel with the relaxation
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
