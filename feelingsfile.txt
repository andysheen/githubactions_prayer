What in the World Is Happening in Israel?
 I already shared that I was feeling blah a few weeks ago
 I wonder how he feels about immortale deI libertas vehementor nos etc
 I feel like I am eating enough
 I feel blessed and grateful
 I feel like saying
 I feel I had to write this post
 I loathe this feeling
 I feel gifted
 I stand there suddenly feeling so alone
 I feel otherwise
 I never anticipated the anxiousness I would feel pressing a publish button
 I want to feel better about my body anyway
 I feel I need a list
 I feel guilty that I am so self centred
 I have been feeling very blah this january february
 I feel like coming back I could
