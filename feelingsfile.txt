 I have been feeling very blah this january february
 I feel better now
 I feel like I made a smalll mark somewhere
 I feel you 4
 I could feel the stares
 I feel we should be focusing on a correction higher
 I am stuffed and feeling bloated as hell but that s ok
 I feel your feelings
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel like I could move right in
 I feel your feelings
 I feel like we are getting nothing done
 I feel like I know you
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I feel very bad about the timing of all of this
 I want to feel better about my body
