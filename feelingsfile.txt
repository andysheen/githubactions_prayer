 I could feel the stares
 I feel is interesting
 I smiled at my teacher feeling excited and optimistic
 I don't think I'm alone in feeling this way
 I be happy and excited and feel loved and pursued
 I feel like I get to do this
 I feel that 18 lands is far too many
 I feel I know for sure
 I am feeling
 I feel a little overdressed for the occasion but all right
 I feel like I got my girl back
 I feel confident that things can only get better
 I feel like I know you
 I feel braggy
 I feel like a kid unwrapping a barbie doll package
 I feel this way as a web developer
 I have been feeling very blah this january february
