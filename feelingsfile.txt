 I feel more comfortable with pastry
 I feel like I am back in the swing of things
 I laugh because I feel so tired all the time you know
 I am feeling better now
 I feel humbled
 I have a feeling I might need to make more :
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
 I feel good
 I do want the cabin to feel joyous while we are here
 I feel for them both
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
 I feel most connected to my imagination
 I remember feeling a peace about that
 I feel like I know you
 I feel so jaded about all the barbarian has done
 I feel inside when I eat cake too
 I find my mind feeling these strange sentiments
 I dont go around hurting pwoplw feelings
 I feel form the very essence amp basis of life
 I feel bright and sharp and ready for the world
 I feel his breath shudder under the finger pressed to him
 I feel like posting
 I must admit I feel euphoric
