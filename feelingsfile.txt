 I feel badly about something that makes me really happy
 I feel like a kid unwrapping a barbie doll package
 I look back on this marketing adventure I feel thankful
 I feel like I'm in a nightmare
 I do want the cabin to feel joyous while we are here
 I remember feeling a peace about that
 I feel otherwise
 I want you to know I feel completely at ease
 I feel like I am under a microscope while eating
 I feel very shamed
 I feel like I could move right in
 I feel it is wrong
 I do really feel that time travels slowly
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
