Man arrested in Pennsylvania over Idaho student murders
 I feel like we are getting nothing done
 I think I should do and what I feel I should do
 I am cranky and grouchy and just feel like eating
 I am cranky and grouchy and just feel like eating
 I feel like I am still on the motorway
 I feel this was the most fully formed
 I feel badly about something that makes me really happy
 I practically feel his hot breath on my neck as I run
 I very likely did something somehow to affect her feelings though
 I feel yet
 I need my computer to feel happy and safe
 I could even begin to explain this movement to without feeling foolish
 I feel most twenty somethings will easily relate to
 I wonder how he feels about immortale deI libertas vehementor nos etc
 I just wish sometimes it was more genuine than it feels
 I feel a little bit depressed for that reason alone
 I never anticipated the anxiousness I would feel pressing a publish button
 I keep having this feeling that we re being watched
 I hope you are feeling fit and well
