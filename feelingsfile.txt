Two Bangladeshi opposition leaders arrested in government crackdown
Portsmouth University loses discrimination case against Indian lecturer
 I could feel this energy and excitement everywhere
 I loathe this feeling
 I feel like we are getting nothing done
 I have a furry feeling in my chest
 I feel like I have a bionic face
 I feel like I really missed out
 I feel very very blessed
 I know to describe how I feel about this
 I feel like lisbon definitely loves jane
 I feel quite mature
 I don't feel complete without children
 I feel so overwhelmed I want to scream
 I feel like posting
 I feel a little bit depressed for that reason alone
 I feel awful
 I feel my enthusiasm for work rapidly dwindling
 I get the feeling I'm looking at winners here
