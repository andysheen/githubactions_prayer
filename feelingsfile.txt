 I feel like they need that
 I feel almost fraudulent mentioning it
 I feel about it
 I feel very very blessed
 I feel fine he said
 I feel okay
 I feel you 4
 I feel so clean and fresh
 I was feeling very healthy
 I feel very bad about the timing of all of this
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel like I'm in a nightmare
 I did what all guilty feeling moms would do
 I need to feel prepared
 I want you to know I feel completely at ease
 I be happy and excited and feel loved and pursued
