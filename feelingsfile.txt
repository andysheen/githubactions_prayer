Weather tracker: freezing conditions sweep south across US
Weather tracker: cyclone drags pollution towards Sri Lanka
 I feel so behind the christmas decorating game this year
 I do feel relieved
 I feel in bed today with the flu funny tumblr lol rofl
 I feel it is wrong
 I feel like I dunno em no more
 I feel like I get to do this
 I will feel them pour down my cheeks
 I want to feel better about my body
 I don't feel like it
 I feel like we almost become content with the messy braid
 I feel like a jerk by leaning on some friends so much
 I feel otherwise
 I know that sometimes I wake up not feeling the best
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
 I need to feel w
 I feel like crawling into a cave and hibernating until spring
