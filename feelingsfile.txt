Death toll rises in Cambodia casino hotel fire
 I feel like writing about
 I woke up feeling very happy
 I feel so lucky
 I could feel the stares
 I feel like I dunno em no more
 I feel and what direction I am going in
 I want you to know I feel completely at ease
 I feel like there has been
 I keep having this feeling that we re being watched
 I will feel sad and I pity them
 I not feel like a rock star when I finished
