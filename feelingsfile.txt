 I get the sweetest feeling erma franklin
 I feel most connected to my imagination
 I feel badly about something that makes me really happy
 I would love to feel the keys
 I am the paper real feel book kinda girl
 I feel like writing something somewhat literal tonight
 I do really feel that time travels slowly
 I just feel super ill equipped for this
 I feel like I should be
 I will feel sad and I pity them
 I feel horrible pssss: I am way too old for that
 I had a feeling I d need it
 I feel I know for sure
 I feel like I know you
